# Fraud card detectiom

We aim to develop a model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions based on transaction-related information (such as time, location, etc.). After proper data pre-processing, we apply machine learning methods as **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest** and follow with hyper parameter tuning. 

Data was obtained from the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023

The dataset contains information on credit card transactions, including the transaction amount, and a target variable named “Class” with values “1” and “0”, indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
